<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Anything good is undercut if its parts or its relation to surroundings is not ideal. The quality of such organization is perceived through the Aesthetic sense: Beauty is the guide to what is worth pursuing. The Caffeine Lobby is a metaphor for the collection of things that 'wake' one up to what is genuinely worth it in life. This collection is up to everybody to create for themselves, and consequently to mold their lives in accordance to what they learn from building it. The lifestyle is rooted in a philosophic system which disavows any split between what one wants to do, and what one should do — as well as upshots like wishes vs. reality, pleasure vs. goodness, ideas vs. materiality, my will vs. the will of others.

<strong>The System in Outline</strong>
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 1.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Perceiving and making judgments presupposes the existence of the faculty that perceives and makes judgments. Thus, existence is the starting point and not the <em>product</em> of this faculty. That which <em>is</em>, is what it is — not less or more than that.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 2.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	That which leads to sensory perception operates according to what it is, thus perception is a <em>natural fact</em>, i.e. outside of judgments of true or false. If sense data is misinterpreted, the error is of interpretation, not of perception.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 3.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Conscious beings perceive the world in the form of the senses; they don't perceive their <em>senses</em> by means of a prior set of senses.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 4.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Abstraction is the mental isolation of an aspect of reality for the purpose of study. Aspects remain the aspects of <em>something</em>: action, height, weight etc. do not exist apart from that which acts and is of a certain height and weight.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 5.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The way a thing behaves is an aspect of what that thing <em>is like</em>. Causality, potentiality and natural law are specialized <em>perspectives</em> on the nature of a given thing.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 6.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Concepts are classifications of things observed through the senses, or of actions performed by the mind in regard to those things (e.g. measurement). Mental manipulations of memorized percepts — blue elephant, perfect circle, dreams, visions — indicate nothing about reality as a whole. Correctly identifying something requires viewing it in light of previously learned facts, i.e. reason.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 7.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Using concepts derived from sensory observation to prove the subjectivity of the senses is circular; so is using the rational faculty to prove <em>reason itself </em>as valid or invalid.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 8.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The natural organization of existents leads to properties which the individual parts do not have. The denser the organization, the more potent it is, e.g. the inorganic level grounds the organic.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 9.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Sense data does not provide sufficient information for humans to determine what to do; volitionally raising one's awareness to the full context is required to understand which choices are beneficial. The absence of volition leads to the inability to deal with things, turning nature into an unpredictable aggressor from which one has to psychologically flee from, or rebel against.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 10.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Man survives by adjusting nature to his needs, not by wishing. Production reduces, in some way, the amount of needed future work, freeing up time for enjoyment. The productive necessity to see causal connections is what keeps the mind characteristically connected to reality.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 11.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Socially, a widespread recognition of reality results in productive competition — since innovation results in better profit for the creator — and widespread aversion to any individual's attempt to swindle other people's achievements, which can be countered with self-defense or finding ways to minimize the damage.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 12.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Distracting oneself from negative feelings prevents their release and can lead to anxiety. Strong anxiety can be reduced by sitting with eyes closed and gently replacing the evasive thoughts with a meaningless syllable, leaving no choice other than to resolve emotions by allowing them to be felt until the end.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 13.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Living requires knowing how to discern truth from falsehood (epistemology), how to calculate the best choices in a given situation (ethics), how to protect oneself from coercion (government); and which <em>decisive</em> aspects of the world are true<em> </em>in spite of apparent exceptions to that norm (art and metaphysics).
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 14.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Beauty is the ideal interplay between elements which are considered desirable. The perception of beauty is <em>fluid</em> according to what is known and needed at any moment. All life strives for the ideal interplay of everything.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 15.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Artistic creation, which produces microcosms for contemplation, can potentially bring forth the strongest acquaintance with what is beautiful to the viewer.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 16.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Beauty and enjoyment is not enticing, but torturous if its ideals cannot actually be lived. They complement <em>success</em> in reality, rather than providing a temporary relief from its evil.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 17.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Grasping one's concept of beauty requires the aggregation of one's knowledge, research and experience into a collection of the best entries, not letting anything go unused.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 18.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The conscious and subconscious form one system. Generating artistic ideas without the organic participation of the subconscious (which connects ideas to meanings and emotions) leads to artificial and empty constructs, cut off from everything.
</p>
<p class="center">
<strong>§. 19.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The keystone of beauty and great art is the power to shake one's notion of what is possible by revealing a markedly better way of living and looking at things.
